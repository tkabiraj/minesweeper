 * Pd. 3

 * 
 * This lab took me about 5 hours.
 * 
 * This lab was really hard because there were so many concepts to get right. The main problem was that I couldn't
 * figure out how to use the interface. After a while I thought of implementing the KeyListener interface in my
 * AI class. It then took a while to come up with the logic of how to solve Minesweeper. The logic that I came up
 * with works but for some reason, it doesn't work when revealing/flagging cells that are only surrounded by
 * numbers greater than 1. Other than that, everything works perfectly.
